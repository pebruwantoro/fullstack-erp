# Explanation of Design Choices

This document provides the rationale for the architectural and technological choices made in this project, discusses the trade-offs, and suggests potential future improvements.

## Rationale for Design Choices

### Backend (`backend-app`)

1.  **Node.js & Express.js**: Chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is highly performant for I/O-intensive operations common in web applications. Express.js provides a minimal and flexible framework for building the REST API.
2.  **Clean Architecture**: The project is structured to separate concerns into distinct layers (Controllers, Use Cases, Repositories, Models). This enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability by decoupling business logic from frameworks and external dependencies.
3.  **PostgreSQL & Sequelize**: PostgreSQL was selected as the relational database for its robustness, reliability, and support for complex data types and transactions. Sequelize is used as an ORM to abstract away raw SQL, leading to faster development and improved code readability.
4.  **Redis**: Integrated for high-performance caching. By storing frequently accessed data in-memory, Redis reduces the load on the primary database and decreases response times.
5.  **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization with Docker ensures a consistent and reproducible environment across development, testing, and production. Docker Compose simplifies the management of the multi-container setup (application, database, Redis).
6.  **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for stateless authentication. JWTs are a standard, secure way to manage user sessions in a distributed or microservices environment.

### Frontend (`frontend-app`)

1.  **React & Vite**: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the creation of reusable and maintainable UI elements. Vite is a modern build tool that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized builds, significantly improving the developer experience.
2.  **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework was used to enable rapid UI development. It allows for building custom designs without leaving the HTML, which speeds up the development process.
3.  **React Router**: The de-facto standard for handling client-side routing in React applications, enabling a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience.

## Trade-offs

1.  **ORM (Sequelize) vs. Raw SQL**: While Sequelize speeds up development, it introduces an abstraction layer that can sometimes lead to less performant queries compared to hand-optimized raw SQL. The trade-off was made in favor of development speed and maintainability.
2.  **Frontend State Management**: The application currently relies on React's built-in state management (e.g., `useState`, `useContext`). This is simpler for the current scale but may become complex and lead to performance issues as the application grows. A dedicated state management library like Redux or Zustand was deferred to avoid premature complexity.
3.  **REST API vs. GraphQL**: A RESTful architecture was chosen for its simplicity and widespread adoption. GraphQL could have offered more flexibility for the client to fetch specific data, but it would have increased the complexity of the backend implementation.
4.  **Monolithic Backend**: The backend is a single service. While this is simpler to manage initially, a microservices architecture could offer better scalability and fault isolation for a much larger and more complex system.

## Future Improvements

1.  **Enhanced Caching Strategy**: Expand the use of Redis to cache more types of data, such as product lists and user profiles, and implement a more sophisticated cache invalidation strategy.
2.  **Introduce a Frontend State Management Library**: As the frontend application grows, integrate a library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to manage global state more efficiently.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Increase test coverage across the board, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure application reliability.
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a full CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment process, enabling faster and more reliable releases.
5.  **Real-time Notifications**: Integrate WebSockets to provide real-time updates to clients, such as notifications for quotation approvals or changes in sales order status.
6.  **Advanced Authorization**: Move from the current role-based access control to a more granular, permission-based system to provide finer control over user actions.
7.  **Observability**: Integrate logging, monitoring, and tracing tools (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana) to gain better insights into the application's performance and health.
